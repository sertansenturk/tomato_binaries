# tomato_binaries
The host repository for the binaries used in the [tomato](https://github.com/sertansenturk/tomato) (**T**urkish-**O**ttoman **M**akam (M)usic **A**nalysis **TO**olbox).

Introduction
------------
**tomato** is a comprehensive and easy-to-use toolbox for the analysis of audio recordings and music scores of Turkish-Ottoman makam music. Several methods in this toolbox, namely score phrase segmentation, score-informed joint tonic identification and tempo estimation, section linking and note-level audio-score alignment algorithms are implemented in MATLAB and compiled as binaries.

These binaries are not stored in **tomato** because they take several megabytes of space and it would take too much space to store them in the repository including the versions introduced in each modification. Instead the binaries are hosted in this repository. The relevant binaries are downloaded from this repository during the installation process of **tomato**.
